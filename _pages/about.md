Hi, I am Ankit Kariryaa. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Machine Learning section](https://di.ku.dk/english/research/machine-learning/), [Department of Computer Science](https://di.ku.dk/english/), [Univesity of Copenhagen](https://ku.dk/english/), where I am working with [Christian Igel](https://christian-igel.github.io/), [Rasmus Fensholt](https://ign.ku.dk/english/employees/geography/?pure=en/persons/24386) and others on Remote Sensing for Unlocking Global Ecosystem Resource Dynamics (DeReEco) project. 

Research Interests
======
My research and teaching interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and remote sensing. In my current position, my research focuses on novel machine learning models to monitor, predict, and simulate changes in ecosystem properties. But I am happy to adorn different hats and move up or down the programming-stack to solve real-world problems.

Education
======
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Bremen, Germany in 2020. During the Ph.D., I studied the negative impacts of user-generated content and developed tools for mitigating some of these impacts. It was on reserach stay with Prof. Fabian Gieseke at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen that I developed my love for remote sensing. After my Ph.D., I joined the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen as a postdoctoral researcher and have been continuing my research on remote sensing.

I did my Master's in Bielefeld University, Germany in Intelligent Systems and during Masterâ€™s, I attended two semesters in University of Helsinki, Finland on an Erasmus exchange program. My Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Harmirpur, India.

Free time
======

I am a big fan of Indian classical music and I love to listen to it. I also like to read books and watch movies. I enjoy most racket sports, but I am only reasonably good (within the bounds of my free time) at some of them. I also enjoy playing board games and card games. Drop me a line if you want to play a game!
